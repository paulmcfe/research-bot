# Vapor Labs Document Archive

## Overview

This archive contains 25 documents from **Vapor Labs**, a fictional dot-com era startup (1999-2001). The company's flagship product, **VaporWare**, was defined primarily by meaningless business jargon—but in the early dot-com boom, that was enough to raise $97 million in funding.

This document collection is designed for use as sample data for **ResearchBot**, a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application built throughout the AI Engineering Bootcamp book.

## Why This Dataset?

Traditional sample data (e.g., ML articles, Wikipedia excerpts) doesn't effectively demonstrate RAG's value—users could just ask any LLM directly. This fictional company archive demonstrates ResearchBot's real power:

- **Unique content**: No LLM has this in training data
- **Rich contradictions**: Different teams had different visions
- **Evolving narrative**: Documents span the company's entire lifecycle
- **Multiple perspectives**: Executives, engineers, customers, press
