MEMORANDUM

TO: All Vapor Labs Employees
FROM: Marcus Chen, CEO
DATE: August 15, 2000
RE: Organizational Changes and Path Forward

Team,

I'm writing to share some difficult news and to be transparent about 
the path ahead for Vapor Labs.

Today, we made the painful decision to reduce our workforce by 
approximately 80 positions, bringing our team from 300 to 220 people. 
This was not a decision made lightly—these are our colleagues, our 
friends, people who believed in our vision and worked incredibly hard 
to make it real.

I want to explain why we made this choice and what it means for our 
future.

THE CONTEXT

Six months ago, the internet economy was booming. Capital was abundant. 
Growth at any cost was the strategy. That world no longer exists.

Since March, the Nasdaq has fallen over 40%. Venture funding has 
dropped 75%. Companies with business models similar to ours have 
failed—Webvan, Pets.com, Kozmo, and dozens more.

We are not immune to these forces. Our enterprise sales cycles have 
lengthened. Our consumer user growth has slowed. Our Series B investors 
have told us clearly: there will be no Series C. We must reach 
profitability with the capital we have.

THE DECISION

After careful analysis with our CFO and board, we determined that our 
previous burn rate of $5 million per month was unsustainable. To extend 
our runway and reach profitability, we needed to reduce our monthly 
burn to approximately $3 million.

The only way to achieve this reduction was through workforce changes. 
We considered every alternative—salary cuts, reduced hours, voluntary 
departures—but none provided sufficient savings.

The affected roles were selected based on three criteria:
1. Alignment with our refocused strategy (Enterprise-first)
2. Functional redundancy created by our rapid growth
3. Performance considerations

I want to be clear: this is not a reflection on the talent or 
dedication of those affected. These are good people in a bad situation 
created by market forces beyond anyone's control.

WHAT'S CHANGING

Beyond the workforce reduction, we are making several strategic changes:

1. ENTERPRISE FOCUS
VaporWare Enterprise is now our sole priority. We have 12 paying 
customers and a strong pipeline. This is where our future lies.

2. CONSUMER PAUSE
VaporWare Personal development is suspended. We will maintain the 
existing beta service but will not invest in new features. This was 
a painful decision—we still believe in the vision—but we must focus.

3. OFFICE CONSOLIDATION
We are closing the New York office and consolidating all operations 
in San Francisco. Affected NY employees have been offered relocation 
packages.

4. MARKETING RESET
Our marketing budget is reduced by 60%. We are shifting from brand 
awareness to demand generation and customer success.

5. LEADERSHIP CHANGES
Tyler Morrison (VP Consumer Products) and Rachel Torres (VP Marketing) 
have left the company. I thank them for their contributions. Their 
responsibilities will be absorbed by existing leadership.

OUR PATH FORWARD

Despite these challenges, I remain optimistic about Vapor Labs' future. 
Here's why:

- We have $38 million in the bank—more than most companies in our space.
- VaporWare Enterprise 1.0 is shipping and customers are paying for it.
- Our enterprise pipeline, while slower, remains solid.
- Our technology is real and solves real problems.

The path to profitability requires us to grow enterprise revenue to 
approximately $25 million annually while maintaining our reduced cost 
structure. This is achievable within 18-24 months.

TO THOSE LEAVING

If you're among those affected today, please know that this decision 
does not diminish your value or your contributions. You helped build 
something real. That matters.

You'll receive:
- 4 weeks of severance pay
- 3 months of COBRA health coverage
- Outplacement support from Right Management
- A strong reference from Vapor Labs

Your equity remains intact according to your vesting schedule.

TO THOSE STAYING

To those remaining, I ask for your continued commitment. The next year 
will be challenging. We have less margin for error. But we also have 
clarity of purpose that we lacked before.

We're no longer chasing every opportunity. We're focused. We know what 
we need to do. And we have the team to do it.

CLOSING THOUGHTS

Three years ago, I had an idea about the future of the networked 
economy. That idea became Vapor Labs. That idea attracted talented 
people like you. That idea raised $97 million from top investors.

The idea wasn't wrong. The timing was harder than we expected. The 
market turned against us. But ideas don't die when markets correct.

Vapor Labs will emerge from this period stronger, more focused, and 
more resilient. I'm asking you to believe in that future—and to help 
us build it.

My door is open. If you have questions, concerns, or just need to 
talk, I'm here.

With gratitude and determination,

Marcus Chen
CEO, Vapor Labs
