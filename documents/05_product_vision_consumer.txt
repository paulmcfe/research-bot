VAPORWARE 1.0: CONSUMER PRODUCT VISION
Author: Tyler Morrison, VP Consumer Products
Version: 1.4
Date: August 3, 1999
Classification: Internal - Strategic

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

VaporWare is a revolutionary consumer internet platform that enables 
ordinary people to create, share, and monetize digital content without 
any technical knowledge. Think of it as "Geocities meets eBay meets 
Napster"—but better.

VaporWare empowers the individual creator in the new economy.

THE OPPORTUNITY

The internet is democratizing content creation. But current tools are 
either too simple (Geocities) or too complex (Dreamweaver). There's a 
massive gap in the market for a platform that combines:

- Ease of use (anyone can create)
- Powerful features (professional results)
- Built-in monetization (creators get paid)
- Community (social features drive engagement)

VaporWare fills this gap.

TARGET USER

Our target user is "Creative Claire"—a 28-year-old who:
- Has a passion (crafts, photography, writing, music)
- Wants to share that passion with the world
- Dreams of turning that passion into income
- Is frustrated by current tools and platforms

There are 50 million Creative Claires in the United States alone.

CORE FEATURES

1. VAPOR STUDIO
   A web-based content creation tool. Users can build websites, edit 
   photos, create animations, and produce music—all in their browser. 
   No downloads required. Templates and wizards make it easy.

2. VAPOR MARKETPLACE
   A built-in marketplace where creators can sell their work. Digital 
   goods (art, music, templates) are delivered automatically. Physical 
   goods are supported through partnerships with fulfillment providers. 
   VaporWare takes a 15% commission on all sales.

3. VAPOR COMMUNITY
   Social features that connect creators with fans. Profiles, following, 
   messaging, forums. Think "Friendster for creators" (Friendster hasn't 
   launched yet but we've seen the concept and it's going to be huge).

4. VAPOR WALLET
   Integrated payment system. Users can receive payments, tip other 
   creators, and purchase VaporCredits for premium features. Plans to 
   add VaporCoin (our own digital currency) in version 2.0.

BUSINESS MODEL

Revenue streams:
- Marketplace commissions: 15% of all transactions
- Premium subscriptions: $9.99/month for advanced features
- Advertising: Display ads on free-tier creator pages
- VaporCredits: Virtual currency with margin on purchase

Projected unit economics:
- Customer acquisition cost: $8 (viral growth reduces over time)
- Lifetime value: $120 (based on 24-month average retention)
- LTV/CAC ratio: 15x

COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE

Direct competitors:
- Geocities (free, but no monetization)
- Tripod (similar to Geocities)
- theGlobe.com (community focus but weak creation tools)

Indirect competitors:
- eBay (marketplace only, no creation)
- Real.com (music only)
- MP3.com (music only)

VaporWare is the only integrated create-share-monetize platform.

GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY

Phase 1 (Q4 1999): Invite-only beta with 10,000 creators
Phase 2 (Q1 2000): Public launch with major PR push
Phase 3 (Q2 2000): Celebrity creator partnerships
Phase 4 (Q3 2000): International expansion

Target: 1 million users by end of 2000, 10 million by end of 2001.

RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS

To execute this vision, we need:
- 40 engineers dedicated to consumer platform
- 15 designers for Vapor Studio
- 10 community managers
- $20 million marketing budget for launch

This represents approximately 60% of our current resources.

NOTE ON ENTERPRISE INITIATIVE

I've reviewed Diana's Enterprise Product Vision document. While I 
respect her technical expertise, I have serious concerns about pursuing 
both enterprise and consumer simultaneously. These are fundamentally 
different businesses requiring different cultures, sales motions, and 
product thinking.

I recommend we focus exclusively on consumer. The enterprise middleware 
market is crowded and commoditizing. The consumer creator economy is 
nascent and will be massive.

I've raised this with Marcus but the decision remains pending.
