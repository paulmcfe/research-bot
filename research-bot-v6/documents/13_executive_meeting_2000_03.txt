MARCUS: Let's skip the small talk. We have a problem. The Nasdaq 
crashed 4% yesterday. Tech stocks are getting murdered. Pets.com is 
down 60%. Webvan is down 50%. The party's over.

DAVID (CFO): I've been running scenarios. At our current burn rate of 
$5 million per month, we have 18 months of runway. But that assumes 
we hit revenue targets, which—Steve?

STEVE (Sales): March is going to miss. Two deals pushed to Q2. One 
customer is asking to renegotiate. Pipeline is slowing.

MARCUS: How bad?

STEVE: We're tracking to $800K for Q1 against a $2M target.

JORDAN: Jesus.

MARCUS: What about the partnerships? Oracle? Sun?

JORDAN: Oracle deal is in legal review—should close in April. Sun is 
pausing "pending market conditions." Cisco went dark.

RACHEL (Marketing): The Super Bowl ad did its job. We got awareness. 
But converting awareness to sales is Steve's problem.

STEVE: That's not fair. You can't generate demand with brand ads. I 
told you we needed demand gen campaigns.

RACHEL: We had a $30 million budget. We used it according to the plan 
everyone approved.

MARCUS: Stop. The blame game doesn't help. Where are we on product?

DIANA (CTO): Enterprise is behind. We're not going to hit Q1. I've been 
saying this for months. Q2 is realistic if we cut scope.

TYLER (Consumer): Personal is actually on track. We could launch beta 
in April.

DIANA: Tyler, with respect, the consumer platform was built on top of 
enterprise infrastructure that isn't stable. If you launch beta and it 
falls over, we look worse than if we wait.

TYLER: We can't keep waiting. The market window is closing.

DIANA: What market window? The consumer internet is imploding.

TYLER: Users don't care about the stock market. They want cool stuff.

DIANA: Cool stuff that loads in 30 seconds because of your Java 
Applets?

MARCUS: Enough. Diana, Tyler, we'll discuss product offline. David, 
what are our options?

DAVID: Three scenarios.

Scenario A - Stay the course. Keep burn at $5M, hope revenue catches 
up. Risk: We run out of cash in 18 months if it doesn't.

Scenario B - Moderate cuts. Reduce burn to $3.5M. Delay some hiring, 
reduce marketing spend, cut contractors. Extends runway to 24 months.

Scenario C - Deep cuts. Reduce burn to $2.5M. Layoffs, office closures, 
focus on enterprise only. Extends runway to 30+ months.

MARCUS: What does Scenario C look like in terms of headcount?

DAVID: We're at 310 people. Scenario C means getting to around 180.

RACHEL: That's a third of the company.

DAVID: Yes.

MARCUS: We're not doing Scenario C. Not yet. But we should plan for 
Scenario B starting now.

JORDAN: What does that mean for my BD team?

DAVID: You lose 2 of your 8 people. And the London office doesn't open.

JORDAN: London is critical for—

MARCUS: Jordan. Market conditions have changed. We need to conserve 
cash.

JORDAN: (silence)

MARCUS: Rachel, how much can you cut from marketing?

RACHEL: VaporCon is $3M. We could postpone it. Print campaigns are $2M 
—I can pause those. That's $5M in savings.

MARCUS: Do it. What about demand gen? Steve says he needs it.

RACHEL: Demand gen is $4M. That's where the leads come from.

STEVE: If you cut demand gen, I can't hit targets.

RACHEL: You're already not hitting targets.

STEVE: With no air cover! You spent everything on brand!

MARCUS: STOP.

(Long silence)

MARCUS: Here's what we're doing. Scenario B. Effective immediately. 
Diana, you have until June to ship Enterprise 1.0. Cut whatever scope 
necessary. Tyler, Consumer beta is on hold until Enterprise ships. 
Steve, reset your targets. I want a realistic number that you can 
actually hit. Rachel, cut $5M from the marketing budget and reallocate 
$2M to demand gen. Jordan, no London office. Keep the 6 people you 
need, move the rest to Steve's team.

David, I want weekly burn reports from now on.

Everyone, this stays in this room. The last thing we need is a morale 
crisis. We tell the team we're being "prudent" and "focused." 
Understood?

ALL: (nods)

MARCUS: One more thing. I'm hearing rumors that people are interviewing 
elsewhere. That's their right. But I need to know if any of you are 
looking. Because if you're not committed, we need to know now.

(Silence)

MARCUS: Good. Let's get back to work.

Meeting ended 10:47 AM.
