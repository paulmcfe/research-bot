VAPOR LABS RAISES $85 MILLION SERIES B AT $400 MILLION VALUATION; 
PREPARES FOR RAPID SCALE

SoftBank Vision Fund Leads Largest B2B Platform Round of 1999

SAN FRANCISCO, CA — Vapor Labs, the category-defining platform company 
transforming enterprise value creation, today announced the close of an 
$85 million Series B funding round. SoftBank Vision Fund led the round, 
with continued participation from Sequoia Capital and Kleiner Perkins, 
and new investors including Goldman Sachs and Fidelity Ventures.

The round values Vapor Labs at $400 million, representing an 8x increase 
from the Series A just eight months ago.

"Vapor Labs represents exactly the kind of bold, transformative thinking 
that defines the new economy," said Masa Tanaka, Investment Director at 
SoftBank. "VaporWare isn't just a product—it's a movement. We're honored 
to fuel this rocket ship."

The funding comes as Vapor Labs reports significant momentum:
- Engineering team has grown from 4 to 127 employees
- VaporWare beta program includes 15 Fortune 500 companies
- Strategic partnerships announced with Oracle, Sun Microsystems, and Cisco
- Named "Startup to Watch" by Red Herring, Wired, and Business 2.0

"Eight months ago, we had a vision," said Marcus Chen, CEO of Vapor Labs. 
"Today, we have a platform, a team, and the partnerships to transform 
how business gets done. This funding lets us go even bigger, even faster."

The company plans aggressive expansion:
- Grow to 500+ employees by end of 2000
- Open offices in New York, London, and Tokyo
- Launch VaporWare 1.0 in Q1 2000
- IPO targeted for late 2000

"The only risk at this point is moving too slowly," Chen added. "In the 
new economy, speed wins. We intend to win."
