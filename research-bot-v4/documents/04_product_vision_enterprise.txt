EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

VaporWare is an enterprise middleware platform that enables seamless 
integration between legacy systems and next-generation web applications. 
At its core, VaporWare provides:

1. A universal data transformation layer
2. Real-time synchronization across heterogeneous systems
3. Enterprise-grade security and compliance
4. Scalable architecture supporting millions of transactions per second

TARGET CUSTOMER

Our primary customer is the Fortune 500 enterprise CIO who faces a 
critical challenge: how to leverage internet technologies without 
abandoning investments in legacy infrastructure. These organizations 
have millions of dollars invested in mainframes, ERP systems, and 
proprietary databases. They cannot simply "rip and replace."

VaporWare solves this problem by creating a seamless bridge between 
old and new.

CORE ARCHITECTURE

VaporWare Enterprise consists of four primary components:

1. VAPOR CONNECT
   The integration backbone. Vapor Connect provides pre-built adapters 
   for major enterprise systems including SAP, Oracle, PeopleSoft, 
   Siebel, and legacy mainframe environments. Custom adapters can be 
   developed using the VaporScript programming language.

2. VAPOR TRANSFORM
   The data normalization engine. Vapor Transform converts data between 
   formats in real-time, handling everything from COBOL copybooks to 
   XML schemas. Proprietary algorithms ensure zero data loss during 
   transformation.

3. VAPOR SYNC
   The real-time synchronization layer. Vapor Sync maintains consistency 
   across distributed systems using our patented Quantum Coherence 
   Protocol (QCP). Supports both synchronous and asynchronous patterns.

4. VAPOR SHIELD
   The security and compliance layer. Vapor Shield provides end-to-end 
   encryption, role-based access control, and audit logging that meets 
   SOX, HIPAA, and emerging e-commerce regulations.

DEPLOYMENT MODEL

VaporWare Enterprise is deployed on-premises within the customer's data 
center. We recommend a minimum of:
- 8 Sun Enterprise 450 servers
- 64GB RAM per node
- Oracle 8i database backend
- Dedicated T3 line for remote monitoring

Professional services engagement required for implementation. Typical 
deployment timeline: 6-12 months.

PRICING MODEL

VaporWare Enterprise is licensed on a per-CPU basis:
- Base platform license: $250,000 per CPU
- Vapor Connect adapters: $50,000 each
- Annual maintenance: 20% of license fees
- Professional services: $2,500/day

Expected average deal size: $2-5 million

COMPETITIVE POSITIONING

Our primary competitors are:
- IBM MQSeries (lacks real-time transformation)
- Tibco (insufficient legacy support)
- Vitria (limited scalability)
- webMethods (consumer-focused, not enterprise-ready)

VaporWare is the only platform that combines all four capabilities—
connect, transform, sync, and shield—in a single integrated solution.

ROADMAP

Q3 1999: VaporWare 0.8 alpha (internal testing)
Q4 1999: VaporWare 0.9 beta (select enterprise partners)
Q1 2000: VaporWare 1.0 general availability
Q3 2000: VaporWare 1.5 (enhanced mainframe support)
Q1 2001: VaporWare 2.0 (multi-tenant SaaS option)

OPEN QUESTIONS

1. Should we support Microsoft environments? Current architecture is 
   Unix-only. Adding Windows NT support would require significant 
   investment but could expand market.

2. What is our position on open-source components? Using open-source 
   could accelerate development but may raise concerns with enterprise 
   buyers.

3. How do we handle the "ASP" trend? Some analysts suggest enterprises 
   will move to hosted solutions. Do we need a hosted offering?
