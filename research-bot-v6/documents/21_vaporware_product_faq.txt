GENERAL QUESTIONS

Q: What is VaporWare Enterprise?
A: VaporWare Enterprise is an integration platform that connects 
enterprise applications, enabling data to flow seamlessly between 
legacy systems and modern web applications.

CRM, HR, finance, manufacturing, and more. VaporWare connects these 
systems, eliminating manual data entry and enabling real-time 
information sharing.

Q: How is VaporWare different from competitors?
A: VaporWare is the only platform that combines:
- Pre-built adapters for major enterprise systems
- Real-time data transformation
- Enterprise-grade security
- Web-based administration
Unlike point solutions, VaporWare is a complete platform.

TECHNICAL QUESTIONS

Q: What systems does VaporWare connect to?
A: VaporWare 1.0 includes adapters for:
- SAP (R/3)
- Oracle Applications (ERP, CRM)
- PeopleSoft
- Siebel
- Flat files (CSV, XML, fixed-width)

Additional adapters coming in version 1.1:
- JD Edwards
- Microsoft Dynamics
- Lotus Notes
- Custom databases via JDBC

Q: What about Vapor Sync? We were promised real-time sync.
A: Vapor Sync is scheduled for version 1.5 (target: Q1 2001). 
Version 1.0 supports batch processing and near-real-time processing 
via polling. True real-time synchronization requires additional 
infrastructure that we're still developing.

Note to sales: This is a common objection. Emphasize that most 
integration scenarios don't require true real-time—near-real-time 
(polling every 60 seconds) is sufficient for 90% of use cases.

Q: What are the performance benchmarks?
A: VaporWare 1.0 can process approximately 10,000 records per minute 
per adapter, depending on record size and transformation complexity. 
For high-volume scenarios, multiple adapter instances can be deployed 
in parallel.

Note to sales: Do not quote the "50,000 transactions per second" 
figure from early marketing materials. This was a theoretical 
maximum that doesn't reflect real-world deployments. Stick to the 
10K/minute figure unless specifically asked.

Q: What are the hardware requirements?
A: Minimum production deployment:
- 2 Sun Enterprise 450 servers (or equivalent)
- 16GB RAM per node
- Oracle 8i Enterprise Edition
- 100GB storage
- 100Mbps network connectivity

Typical enterprise deployment is 4-8 servers depending on volume.

Q: Does VaporWare support Windows?
A: Version 1.0 requires Solaris or Linux. Windows support is 
planned for version 2.0.

Note to sales: If this is a blocker, emphasize that most enterprises 
run critical infrastructure on Unix/Linux anyway. Position Windows 
requirement as a technical concern, not a limitation.

Q: Can VaporWare run in a hosted environment?
A: Version 1.0 is on-premises only. We are evaluating hosted options 
for future versions.

PRICING QUESTIONS

Q: How is VaporWare priced?
A: VaporWare uses a per-CPU license model:
- Base platform: $100,000 per CPU
- Each adapter: $25,000
- Annual maintenance: 20% of license fees

Q: Wait, the original pricing was $250K per CPU. What changed?
A: We adjusted pricing to be more competitive. Use the $100K figure 
for all new deals. Existing customers on $250K pricing will be 
migrated at renewal.

Q: Is there a discount for multi-year deals?
A: Yes. Standard discounts:
- 2-year commitment: 10% discount
- 3-year commitment: 15% discount
- 4+ year commitment: 20% discount

Additional discounts require VP approval.

Q: What does professional services cost?
A: Standard rate is $2,000/day. Complex implementations typically 
require 30-60 days of PS engagement. Budget $60K-$120K for PS in 
addition to license fees.

COMPETITIVE QUESTIONS

Q: How does VaporWare compare to IBM MQSeries?
A: MQSeries is primarily messaging middleware—it moves data but 
doesn't transform it. VaporWare includes transformation, which 
eliminates the need for custom development.

Q: How does VaporWare compare to Tibco?
A: Tibco is strong in real-time messaging but weak in enterprise 
application integration. VaporWare's pre-built adapters dramatically 
reduce implementation time.

Q: How does VaporWare compare to webMethods?
A: webMethods is consumer-focused and lacks the enterprise security 
features that regulated industries require. VaporWare is enterprise-
first.

Q: What about Microsoft BizTalk?
A: BizTalk is Windows-only and best suited for Microsoft-centric 
environments. VaporWare is platform-agnostic and has deeper support 
for SAP, Oracle, and other major enterprise systems.

COMPANY QUESTIONS

Q: I heard about layoffs at Vapor Labs. Is the company stable?
A: Vapor Labs remains well-capitalized with a clear path to 
profitability. Like many technology companies, we've adjusted our 
cost structure to reflect market conditions. This positions us for 
long-term success.

Key points:
- We have significant cash reserves
- We're growing revenue quarter-over-quarter
- We have a clear enterprise focus
- VaporWare 1.0 is in production at major enterprises

Q: What happened to VaporWare Personal?
A: VaporWare Personal was a parallel initiative focused on 
individual users. We've paused development to focus entirely on 
enterprise customers.

Note to sales: Do not position this as "failure" or "cancellation." 
It was a strategic choice to focus resources.

Q: Are you still planning an IPO?
A: We don't comment on future financing plans. We're focused on 
building a sustainable business.

Q: What if Vapor Labs goes out of business? What happens to my 
deployment?
A: We offer source code escrow arrangements for enterprise customers. 
In the unlikely event of a business discontinuity, escrowed source 
code would be released, ensuring you can continue operating.
