### Rules for Frontend

- You must pay attention to visual clarity and contrast. Do not place white text on a white background.
- You must ensure the UX is pleasant. Boxes should grow to fit their contents, etc. 
- You must ensure the UI is fully accessible.
- You must ensure the UI is responsive so that it shows well on any size screen.
- When asking the user for sensitive information, you must use password style text-entry boxes in the UI.
- Use only modern, vanilla CSS and JavaScript. No dependencies. 
- This frontend will ultimately be deployed on Vercel, but it should be possible to test locally. 
- Always provide users with a way to run the created UI once you have created it.

Use a dark theme with the following colors:
- Primary: hsl(217 91% 60%) (blue)
- Background: hsl(215 28% 17%) (dark gray)
- Text: hsl(210 20% 98%)(white)
- Accent: hsl(160 84% 39%) (green)
