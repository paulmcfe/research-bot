EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Vapor Labs proposes a strategic partnership with Oracle Corporation 
to jointly deliver next-generation enterprise integration capabilities. 
This partnership would combine Oracle's database and application 
platform leadership with VaporWare's innovative integration technology.

The proposed partnership includes:
- Technology: Deep integration between VaporWare and Oracle 8i/9i
- Go-to-market: Joint sales and marketing programs
- Product: Oracle-certified VaporWare adapters
- Investment: Oracle participation in future Vapor Labs funding rounds

This partnership would accelerate both companies' positions in the 
rapidly growing enterprise integration market.

MARKET OPPORTUNITY

The enterprise integration market is projected to grow from $3 billion 
in 1999 to $15 billion by 2003 (Source: IDC). Key drivers:
- Enterprise adoption of internet technologies
- Merger and acquisition activity requiring system consolidation
- Y2K remediation exposing integration weaknesses
- Shift to e-commerce requiring backend integration

Oracle is well-positioned in this market but faces challenges:
- MQSeries (IBM) dominates messaging middleware
- Tibco and Vitria are gaining share in integration platforms
- Lack of a unified integration story across Oracle products

VaporWare addresses these challenges with a comprehensive platform 
that is Oracle-native from the ground up.
