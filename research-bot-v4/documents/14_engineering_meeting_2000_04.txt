DIANA: I'm going to level with you. We're not in a good place.

Enterprise 1.0 is two months late. The market is in freefall. Exec 
team is talking about layoffs. We need to ship something, soon, or 
this company may not survive.

I've pushed back on the business for months. I told them we were 
trying to do too much. I was overruled. But that's water under the 
bridge. What matters now is execution.

Here's the plan.

ENTERPRISE 1.0 - SURVIVAL SCOPE

We're cutting the scope to the absolute minimum viable product. What 
ships in June:

SHIPPING:
- Vapor Connect with 5 adapters: SAP, Oracle ERP, PeopleSoft, Siebel, 
  flat file. That's it.
- Vapor Transform for basic data formats: CSV, XML, fixed-width. No 
  EDI. No COBOL copybooks.
- Vapor Shield with basic LDAP authentication. No Kerberos. No SSO.
- Admin console for configuration and monitoring.

NOT SHIPPING (DEFERRED TO 1.1):
- Vapor Sync (the whole thing)
- Advanced adapters (MQSeries, CICS, mainframe)
- Oracle RAC support
- High-availability clustering
- VaporScript SDK
- Performance optimization (we'll address specific issues only)

LISA (Lead, Connect): Diana, customers are expecting Sync. We've 
demoed it. Sales has promised it.

DIANA: I know. Steve is resetting expectations with customers. We'll 
position it as a "fast follow" in version 1.1.

LISA: They're going to be pissed.

DIANA: Yes. But pissed customers who have a working product is better 
than no customers because we never shipped.

AMIT (Lead, Transform): What about the multi-database support? We've 
been working on MySQL for two months.

KEVIN: Oracle only for 1.0. MySQL goes to 1.1.

AMIT: That's a lot of wasted work.

KEVIN: I know. I'm sorry. We'll use it in 1.1.

DIANA: I want to be clear about something. I'm not blaming this team. 
You've been asked to do impossible things with impossible timelines. 
The decisions that got us here were made above your pay grade. I take 
responsibility for not pushing back harder.

But now we need to focus. Eight weeks. That's what we have. No new 
features. Bug fixes only. Get the five adapters working reliably. Get 
Transform handling the common cases without errors. Get the admin 
console to a point where customers can actually use it without calling 
support.

Questions?

SAM (Senior, Shield): What happens if we don't ship in June?

DIANA: (pause) I don't know exactly. But I know it's bad. We're 
burning $5 million a month. Revenue is behind. If we don't have a 
product to sell, we don't have a company.

SAM: That's terrifying.

DIANA: It is. But I'd rather you know the stakes than pretend 
everything is fine.

KEVIN: On a practical level, here's what this means for the next 
eight weeks:

- All hands on deck for Enterprise. Consumer team is being merged in.
- No time off unless it's an emergency.
- We're going to war rooms by component. Lisa owns Connect. Amit owns 
  Transform. Sam owns Shield. I'll coordinate cross-team dependencies.
- Daily standups at 9 AM. No exceptions.
- Weekly demos to exec team every Friday.

PRIYA (Senior, Consumer): What happens to VaporWare Personal?

DIANA: On hold. Tyler is... no longer with the company. The consumer 
team is being reassigned to Enterprise.

PRIYA: So all the work we did...

DIANA: It's not wasted. We'll come back to it. But right now, 
Enterprise is survival.

(Murmurs throughout the room)

DIANA: I know this is hard. I know some of you joined for the consumer 
vision. I know some of you are thinking about leaving. I can't stop 
you. But I can tell you this: if we ship Enterprise 1.0 in June, if 
we prove that VaporWare works, if we get to cash-flow breakeven—then 
we have a company. And that company can do amazing things.

The next eight weeks will define whether that happens.

I'm asking you to believe. And to execute.

Can I count on you?

(Silence, then nods)

DIANA: Thank you. Let's get to work.
