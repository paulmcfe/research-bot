OPENING REMARKS - Marcus Chen, CEO

Marcus opened by celebrating our incredible momentum. "When I started 
this company five months ago, there were four of us in a garage. Today, 
there are 65 of us in a 15,000 square foot office. That's not just 
growth—that's destiny."

He reviewed the Series A close ($12M from Sequoia, Kleiner) and 
confirmed we're now in active discussions for Series B. "The investors 
see what we see: VaporWare is going to change everything."

Marcus announced we've hit 50 engineers and expects to reach 100 by 
end of summer. "Hire fast, hire smart, hire relentlessly."

PRODUCT UPDATE - Diana Reeves, CTO

Diana presented the VaporWare technical architecture. Key points:
- Built on Java for portability
- Oracle database backend
- CORBA for component communication
- Targeting enterprise middleware market

Diana showed an early demo of Vapor Connect transforming data between 
SAP and a web application. The demo mostly worked, though there was a 
brief crash that Diana handled gracefully ("That's why it's an alpha!").

Timeline: Alpha in Q3, Beta in Q4, 1.0 in Q1 2000.

Question from audience: "Will we support Windows?"
Diana: "Our customers run Solaris. Windows is not a priority."

interested in VaporWare beta. "The demand is real. We just need to 
build the product fast enough."

Q&A

Q: When do we expect to be profitable?
Marcus: Profitability is not the goal right now. Growth is the goal. 
We're investing every dollar into building the future. Profitability 
will come when we own the market.

Q: Are we going public?
Marcus: Can't comment on that specifically, but I'll say the IPO 
market for internet companies has never been hotter. Draw your own 
conclusions.

Q: The office is getting crowded. Are we expanding?
Jordan: Yes, we're looking at the floor above us. Should have an 
answer by end of month.

Q: Can we get better coffee?
Marcus: (laughs) We just raised $12 million and you're asking about 
coffee? Fine. Jennifer, make it happen. Get the good stuff.

CLOSING

Marcus closed with a rally cry: "We're building something that matters. 
Every line of code, every sales call, every customer conversation—it 
all adds up. We're not just a startup. We're a movement. Let's crush 
the second half of the year!"

Applause. Meeting ended at 11:45 AM.

Next All-Hands: July 20, 1999
