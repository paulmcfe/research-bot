WELCOME TO VAPOR LABS

OUR MISSION

To architect the foundational infrastructure layer for next-generation 
digital experiences, enabling seamless value creation across the 
entire spectrum of human endeavor.

OUR VALUES

THINK BIG
We're not here to make incremental improvements. We're here to 
transform industries. Dream big, then figure out how to make it real.

MOVE FAST
Speed is a competitive advantage. We'd rather ship something imperfect 
and iterate than wait for perfection that never comes.

OWN IT
Every Vapor Labs employee is an owner—literally (thanks to stock 
options) and figuratively. Take responsibility. Make decisions. 
Don't wait for permission.

WIN TOGETHER
We succeed as a team or not at all. Help your colleagues. Share 
credit. Celebrate wins together.

AT-WILL EMPLOYMENT

EQUAL OPPORTUNITY
Vapor Labs is committed to equal opportunity. We do not discriminate 
based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, 
or any other protected status.

All offers of employment are contingent on successful completion 
of a background check.

CONFIDENTIALITY
You will have access to confidential information about our technology,

critical. You'll sign a Confidentiality Agreement on your first day.

WORK ENVIRONMENT

HOURS
We don't track hours. We track results. Most employees work somewhere 
between 50-60 hours per week, but it varies based on project needs. 
We're a startup—sometimes you'll need to push hard.

REMOTE WORK
We believe in the power of in-person collaboration. All employees 
are expected to work from the office at least 4 days per week. Remote 
work arrangements may be approved by your manager for special 
circumstances.

DRESS CODE
Casual. Seriously, wear what makes you comfortable.

---

CONDUCT & PERFORMANCE

CODE OF CONDUCT
We expect all employees to act with integrity and professionalism. 
This includes:
- Treating colleagues with respect
- Being honest in all communications
- Protecting company assets and information
- Avoiding conflicts of interest
- Complying with all laws and regulations

HARASSMENT
Vapor Labs has zero tolerance for harassment of any kind. If you 
experience or witness harassment, report it immediately to HR.

PERFORMANCE REVIEWS
Formal reviews happen twice per year (January and July). Informal 
feedback should happen continuously.

---

SEPARATION

RESIGNATION
We request two weeks' notice for resignations, though we understand 
circumstances vary.

TERMINATION
In cases of termination, we strive to handle the process with 
dignity and respect. Severance may be provided at the company's 
discretion based on circumstances and tenure.

RETURN OF PROPERTY
All company property (laptop, badge, documents, etc.) must be 
returned on your last day.
