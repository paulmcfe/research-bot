THE VAPOR LABS STORY: LESSONS LEARNED
Written by Diana Reeves, Former CTO

PREFACE

It's been eighteen months since Vapor Labs closed its doors. I've 
spent that time reflecting on what we built, what we broke, and what 
I learned.

This document is my attempt to capture those lessons. I'm sharing 
it because I believe our story—both the successes and the failures—
has value for the next generation of builders.

I was there from the beginning to the end. I saw the highs and the 
lows. This is my honest account.

THE BEGINNING: WHY WE STARTED

Marcus and I met at a Stanford entrepreneurship seminar in 1998. 
He was a consultant looking to start something; I was a researcher 
looking for impact. We started talking about the problems we saw 
in enterprise software.

The core insight was real: enterprises were drowning in disconnected 
systems. Every merger, every new application, every technology shift 
created more complexity. IT departments spent 70% of their budgets 
just keeping things connected. There had to be a better way.

We called the company "Vapor Labs" as a joke—a reference to 
"vaporware," the tech industry term for products that are announced 
but never ship. It was self-deprecating humor. We thought we were 
being clever.

In retrospect, we should have picked a different name.

---

THE FUNDRAISING: TOO MUCH, TOO FAST

We raised $12 million in Series A in March 1999. Eight months later, 
we raised $85 million in Series B at a $400 million valuation.

That sounds like success, but it was actually one of our biggest 
mistakes.

We hadn't shipped a product yet. We had a promising prototype and 
a big vision, but no proof that customers would pay or that we could 
execute. The money didn't validate our business—it validated that 
we were good at raising money.

The $85 million came with expectations. Investors wanted to see 
500 employees, offices on three continents, and a path to IPO. So 
that's what we built, even though we weren't ready.

Lesson: Raise the money you need, not the money you can get. Every 
dollar comes with expectations. Make sure you can meet them.

---

THE VISION: TOO MUCH, PERIOD

In September 1999, Marcus declared that we would build a "unified 
platform" serving both enterprise and consumer markets. When I 
objected, I was overruled.

I should have pushed harder. Or I should have quit.

The unified vision was intellectually appealing but practically 
impossible. Enterprise and consumer products have different 
requirements, different timelines, different cultures. Trying to 
do both stretched our team beyond breaking.

Engineers were pulled between projects. Deadlines slipped. Quality 
suffered. By the time we shipped Enterprise 1.0, we were six months 
late and missing key features. Customers were disappointed. 
Competitors had caught up.

Meanwhile, our consumer product never launched beyond a limited 
beta that we eventually abandoned.

Lesson: Focus is not just about what you do—it's about what you 
don't do. Saying no is leadership.

---

THE CULTURE: FROM MISSION TO MADNESS

In the early days, we had a real culture. Small teams, shared 
mission, honest debate. We argued about technical decisions because 
we cared. We shipped code we were proud of.

As we grew, the culture fractured. Hiring 300 people in 18 months 
doesn't just add headcount—it dilutes values. New hires didn't 
know why we made the choices we made. They just saw processes 
and politics.

The exec team stopped being honest with each other. Marcus was 
increasingly isolated, surrounded by people who told him what he 
wanted to hear. When I raised concerns about the product timeline, 
I was labeled as "not a team player."

The Super Bowl ad was the turning point. We spent $2.2 million 
on a 30-second commercial for a product that wasn't ready. When I 
objected, I was told to "stay in my lane."

That was when I knew we were in trouble.

Lesson: Culture doesn't scale automatically. It requires constant 
attention. And watch out for leaders who stop welcoming bad news.

THE MARKET: TIMING IS EVERYTHING

Even with all our mistakes, we might have survived if the market 
hadn't turned. The dot-com crash of 2000-2001 killed hundreds of 
companies, many of them better-run than us.

But here's the thing: we should have been prepared. The signs were 
there. By late 1999, valuations were clearly disconnected from 
reality. We could have raised a smaller Series B. We could have 
built a sustainable cost structure. We chose to believe the party 
would last forever.

When the crash came, we had $97 million in funding but $5 million 
per month in expenses. We cut costs, but not fast enough. We never 
reached profitability.

In the end, we sold the VaporWare Enterprise assets to Oracle for 
$12 million—enough to give investors partial recovery but nothing 
for employees. The consumer product was shut down entirely.

Lesson: The market will turn. Build your company as if it might 
turn tomorrow.

THE TECHNOLOGY: WE GOT THIS PART RIGHT (MOSTLY)

Despite everything, I'm proud of what we built technically.

The Vapor Connect architecture was sound. The adapter framework 
was genuinely innovative. Some of the code we wrote ended up in 
Oracle's products after the acquisition.

Our biggest technical mistake was trying to support too many 
platforms. We started Unix-only, then added Windows, then added 
hosted, then added consumer. Each addition fragmented our engineering 
effort.

If I did it again, I would pick one platform and make it excellent 
before expanding.

Lesson: Technical breadth looks impressive on slides but kills 
teams in practice. Depth first, breadth later.

---

THE PEOPLE: TALENT ISN'T ENOUGH

We hired incredibly talented people. MIT engineers, Stanford MBAs, 
industry veterans. On paper, we had a dream team.

But talent isn't enough. You need alignment. You need trust. You 
need a shared understanding of what you're building and why.

We had brilliant people pulling in different directions. Tyler 
wanted consumer, I wanted enterprise, Marcus wanted both. The 
engineering team was caught in the middle.

After the layoffs, we lost most of our best people. Not because 
they were laid off—because they saw the writing on the wall and 
left for more stable opportunities. By the end, the people who 
stayed were mostly those who couldn't find something else.

Lesson: Hire for alignment first, talent second. And when you 
start losing your best people voluntarily, pay attention—they 
see something you don't.

MY OWN FAILURES

I've been critical of Marcus throughout this document. But I need 
to own my part.

I was the CTO. The technology was my responsibility. And I failed 
in several ways:

1. I didn't push back hard enough on the unified vision. When I was 
   overruled, I should have made my concerns more explicit to the 
   board.

2. I didn't protect my team from the chaos. I let them get pulled 
   in too many directions.

3. I underestimated the complexity of the architecture changes. 
   When we pivoted to support consumer, I should have insisted on 
   more time.

4. I didn't leave when I should have. By staying, I gave legitimacy 
   to decisions I disagreed with.

If you're in a similar situation, be braver than I was.

WHAT I'D DO DIFFERENTLY

If I could do it all again:

1. Raise less money and keep more control.
2. Focus on one product for one market until it's working.
3. Build a sustainable cost structure from day one.
4. Hire slower, especially in non-engineering roles.
5. Be more honest about what I didn't know.
6. Leave if I couldn't change things.

THE LESSONS, SUMMARIZED

For founders and executives:
- Focus is a strategic advantage. Say no.
- Raise what you need, not what you can.
- The market will turn. Be ready.
- Culture requires constant attention.
- Hire for alignment, not just talent.
- Welcome bad news. Seek it out.

For employees:
- Equity is not compensation. Don't bet your life on it.
- Watch how leaders respond to challenges. That's who they really are.
- If something feels wrong, it probably is.
- Your reputation survives any single company. Protect it.

For everyone:
- Failure is a better teacher than success.
- The story isn't over when the company ends.
- What you learn matters more than what you earn.

EPILOGUE

Marcus is now a venture capitalist. He seems to be doing well. 
We don't talk.

Most of the team has landed on their feet. Some are at big tech 
companies. Some started their own companies. A few left tech 
entirely. Everyone learned something.

As for me, I joined a small research lab where I'm doing the kind 
of deep technical work I love. No more executive meetings. No more 
board presentations. No more Super Bowl ads.

I still believe in the problem we were trying to solve. Integration 
remains one of the hardest challenges in enterprise software. 
Someday, someone will crack it.

It just won't be us.
