TICKET #1247
Date: September 3, 2000
Customer: Midwest Financial Services
Contact: Tom Bradley, Director of IT Integration
Priority: HIGH

Subject: VaporWare crashing during SAP data sync

Description:
We've been running VaporWare Enterprise 1.0 for three weeks and are 
experiencing regular crashes during our nightly SAP data synchronization. 
The Vapor Connect SAP adapter throws a "Connection Pool Exhausted" error 
after processing approximately 50,000 records. Our nightly batch is 
2 million records.

We were told during the sales process that VaporWare could handle 
"millions of transactions per second." This is not matching our 
experience.

Additionally, your documentation refers to "Vapor Sync" functionality 
that we were expecting to use, but this appears to be missing from 
the product. Can you clarify?

Please advise urgently. Our integration deadline is September 30.

RESPONSE (Support Engineer: Lisa Chang)
Date: September 4, 2000

Mr. Bradley,

Thank you for contacting Vapor Labs support. I apologize for the issues 
you're experiencing.

Regarding the "Connection Pool Exhausted" error: This is a known issue 
in version 1.0 related to connection handling in the SAP adapter. A 
patch is scheduled for version 1.0.1, targeted for release on September 
15. In the meantime, you can work around the issue by:
1. Reducing batch size to 10,000 records
2. Adding a 30-second pause between batches
3. Increasing the JVM heap size to 2GB (see attached config)

Regarding Vapor Sync: This feature was originally planned for version 
1.0 but has been rescheduled for version 1.5, expected in Q1 2001. I 
apologize for any confusion caused by our documentation. We are working 
to update all materials.

I've escalated your account to our Customer Success team. Your 
assigned representative, James Wilson, will contact you within 24 
hours to discuss your September 30 deadline.

Best regards,
Lisa Chang
Senior Support Engineer

TICKET #1312
Date: September 18, 2000
Customer: Pacific Healthcare Group
Contact: Sandra Lee, CTO
Priority: CRITICAL

Subject: Security vulnerability in Vapor Shield

Description:
Our security team has identified what appears to be a significant 
vulnerability in the Vapor Shield authentication module. We were able 
to bypass LDAP authentication by passing a malformed username parameter.

I am attaching our security team's full report. This is a critical 
finding that potentially exposes our patient data (covered under HIPAA).

We need immediate response. If this is not resolved within 72 hours, 
we will need to take VaporWare offline pending a full security audit.

RESPONSE (Support Engineer: Sam Patel - escalated to CTO)
Date: September 18, 2000

Dr. Lee,

Thank you for bringing this to our immediate attention. This is now 
our highest priority issue.

I've escalated this directly to Diana Reeves, our CTO, and our 
security team lead. You should expect a call within the hour.

Our preliminary assessment confirms the vulnerability you identified. 
We are preparing an emergency patch. Current ETA: 24 hours.

In the meantime, we strongly recommend:
1. Restrict VaporWare access to internal network only
2. Enable the additional IP whitelist feature in Vapor Shield
3. Increase authentication logging to capture any suspicious activity

We take security extremely seriously. Thank you for responsible 
disclosure.

Sam Patel
Principal Support Engineer

FOLLOW-UP (Diana Reeves, CTO)
Date: September 19, 2000

Dr. Lee,

I wanted to personally follow up regarding the security issue.

We have released VaporWare 1.0.2, which contains a fix for the 
authentication bypass vulnerability. This patch is now available for 
download on our customer portal.

Additionally, I've authorized a complimentary security audit of your 
VaporWare deployment by our professional services team. James Wilson 
will coordinate scheduling.

I apologize for this issue. Security is foundational to VaporWare, and 
we fell short. We are implementing additional security review processes 
to prevent similar issues in future releases.

Please don't hesitate to contact me directly if you have concerns.

Diana Reeves
CTO, Vapor Labs

TICKET #1398
Date: October 10, 2000
Customer: Atlantic Insurance Group
Contact: Michael Torres, VP Technology
Priority: MEDIUM

Subject: Question about VaporWare roadmap and company viability

Description:
I'll be direct. We've seen the news about the tech sector. We've 
seen reports of layoffs at Vapor Labs. We have a 3-year contract with 
you and VaporWare is now central to our integration architecture.

Before we invest more in this platform, we need assurance that Vapor 
Labs will be around to support it.

Questions:
1. What is Vapor Labs' current financial position?
2. Is VaporWare development continuing?
3. What happens to our deployment if Vapor Labs fails?
4. Is there any escrow arrangement for the source code?

I don't expect you to share confidential information, but we need 
enough confidence to continue our investment.

RESPONSE (Jordan Blake, VP Business Development)
Date: October 11, 2000

Michael,

Thank you for your direct questions. You deserve direct answers.

1. FINANCIAL POSITION
Vapor Labs is well-capitalized with sufficient runway to reach 
profitability. We recently completed a restructuring to align our 
cost structure with current market conditions. We have over $35 
million in cash and are growing revenue quarter-over-quarter.

2. DEVELOPMENT CONTINUATION
VaporWare Enterprise development is our top priority. Version 1.1, 
with significant performance improvements and new adapters, is on 
track for Q4 2000. Version 1.5 with Vapor Sync is planned for Q1 2001.

3. BUSINESS CONTINUITY
In the unlikely event of a business discontinuity, your perpetual 
license would remain valid. You would continue to have the right to 
use the software you've licensed.

4. SOURCE CODE ESCROW
We do offer source code escrow arrangements for enterprise customers. 
I'm copying James Wilson, your account executive, to discuss terms 
and conditions.

I want to be clear: Vapor Labs is committed to VaporWare and to our 
customers. We're taking the steps necessary to build a sustainable 
business. That's good for us and good for you.

I'm available for a call if you'd like to discuss further.

Jordan Blake
VP Business Development

TICKET #1456
Date: November 3, 2000
Customer: Individual user (VaporWare Personal beta)
Contact: Jennifer Murphy
Priority: LOW

Subject: When will Vapor Studio get new templates?

Description:
Hi! I love Vapor Studio and have built three websites with it already. 
But the template selection is kind of limited. I've been waiting for 
new templates since August and haven't seen any.

Also, some of my friends want to sign up for the beta but the signup 
page says "coming soon" and doesn't let them register.

Are you guys still working on this? I really hope so because it's 
the best website builder I've used!

RESPONSE (Support Engineer: Automated Response)

VaporWare Personal is currently in limited beta and we are not 
accepting new registrations at this time. We appreciate your 
enthusiasm and encourage you to check our website for updates.

Regarding new templates: We are focused on platform stability 
improvements at this time. New templates will be announced when 
available.

Thank you for your patience and support.

INTERNAL NOTE (appended by Kevin Park)
November 5, 2000

This is the 47th inquiry about Personal beta status this month. 
Consumer product is suspended but we never communicated this to 
beta users. We should probably:
a) Send official communication about Personal status
b) Decide whether to shut down the beta or keep it running
c) Update the website

Added to backlog. Not priority given Enterprise focus.
