MEMORANDUM

TO: All Vapor Labs Employees
FROM: Marcus Chen, CEO
DATE: October 3, 2001
RE: Vapor Labs Wind-Down

Team,

I'm writing to share the news that Vapor Labs will be ceasing 
operations effective October 31, 2001.

After exploring all available options—including additional funding, 
strategic acquisitions, and management restructuring—the Board of 
Directors and I have concluded that we cannot continue as an 
independent company.

WHAT'S HAPPENING

Oracle Corporation has agreed to acquire our VaporWare Enterprise 
technology and intellectual property. This transaction provides 
partial recovery for our investors and ensures that our technology 
will continue to be developed.

The acquisition does not include employment offers for Vapor Labs 
staff. Oracle is acquiring assets, not the business as a going 
concern.

TIMELINE

October 3-12: Transition planning
October 15-26: Knowledge transfer to Oracle
October 31: Final day of operations
November 15: Final paycheck issued

EMPLOYEE CONSIDERATIONS

Severance: All employees will receive 4 weeks of severance pay.

Health Insurance: COBRA continuation will be available. Vapor Labs 
will pay COBRA premiums through December 31, 2001.

Stock Options: Unfortunately, the acquisition price does not provide 
meaningful value for common stockholders. After preferred shareholders 
are paid, there is no remaining distribution for option holders. I'm 
deeply sorry about this.

Outplacement: We have engaged Right Management to provide career 
transition services. This includes resume review, interview coaching, 
and job placement assistance. Details will be shared tomorrow.

References: All managers should provide positive references for 
team members seeking new employment. HR will also provide employment 
verification and standard reference letters.

Equipment: You may purchase your company laptop for $1. Details from 
IT to follow.

WHAT HAPPENED

You deserve an honest answer about how we got here.

We raised too much money too fast. We tried to do too much at once. 
We built for a market that evaporated. When the environment changed, 
we couldn't adapt quickly enough.

But I also want to say this: the technology we built was real. The 
problems we were solving were real. The customers we helped are 
still using our software. That matters.

The company is ending, but what we created has value. Oracle is 
paying to acquire it. That's not nothing.

THANK YOU

To every person who believed in Vapor Labs—who showed up, worked 
hard, and gave their best—thank you.

You took a chance on a startup. You worked long hours. You believed 
in a vision. The outcome isn't what any of us wanted, but the effort 
was real and it mattered.

Many of you will go on to start your own companies, or lead teams, 
or build things that change the world. What you learned here—about 
technology, about building products, about working through hard 
times—that goes with you.

LOGISTICS

Please clear your personal belongings from the office by October 26.
Return your badge and any company materials by October 31.
Final checks will be mailed to your home address.
HR will be available for questions through October 31.

I'll be here until the end, and my door is open if you want to talk.

Thank you for everything.

Marcus Chen
CEO, Vapor Labs
