TO THE VAPOR LABS TEAM:

I've reviewed the competing product visions from Diana (Enterprise) and 
Tyler (Consumer). Both are excellent. Both represent massive opportunities. 
And I've decided: we're doing both.

Wait—hear me out.

The conventional wisdom says you have to pick a lane. Enterprise or 
consumer. B2B or B2C. That thinking is obsolete. The internet dissolves 
these boundaries. The future is B2B2C.

VaporWare will be a unified platform that serves both enterprises and 
consumers—because they're actually the same thing.

THE UNIFIED VISION

Here's the insight that changes everything: enterprises are made of people. 
Consumers work at enterprises. What if the same platform that empowers 
Creative Claire on weekends also powers her company's critical business 
processes during the week?

VaporWare 1.0 will be a single platform with two faces:

VAPORWARE ENTERPRISE
For businesses, VaporWare provides the integration, transformation, and 
synchronization capabilities Diana outlined. This generates high-margin 
license revenue and establishes us in the enterprise.

VAPORWARE PERSONAL
For individuals, VaporWare provides the creation, sharing, and monetization 
capabilities Tyler outlined. This generates transaction revenue and builds 
our user base.

THE BRIDGE
Here's the magic: these aren't separate products. They share a common 
core—the Vapor Engine. Data flows seamlessly between enterprise and personal 
contexts. An employee can use VaporWare Personal to create a presentation, 
then publish it through VaporWare Enterprise. A consumer can access 
enterprise content through their personal workspace.

This is unprecedented. This is the future. This is VaporWare.

ORGANIZATIONAL IMPLICATIONS

To execute this vision, I'm restructuring the product organization:

- Diana remains CTO and will oversee the Vapor Engine core technology
- Tyler becomes GM of VaporWare Personal
- We're hiring a new GM of VaporWare Enterprise (search underway)
- Both GMs report to Diana on technology, to Jordan on go-to-market

I know this is complex. I know some of you wanted a cleaner choice. But 
the biggest companies don't make easy choices—they find ways to do it all.

We have $97 million in the bank. We have the team. We have the vision.

Let's build the future.

Marcus
