THE INTEGRATION PROBLEM

Today's enterprise is a maze of disconnected systems.

Your ERP doesn't talk to your CRM. Your HR system doesn't sync with 
payroll. Your manufacturing floor is blind to your supply chain.

The result? Manual data entry. Errors. Delays. Missed opportunities.

You've tried to solve this before. Custom integration projects. 
Point-to-point connections. Middleware that promised much and 
delivered little.

There has to be a better way.

There is. It's called VaporWare.
