EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Q3 2000 was a quarter of difficult decisions and strategic 
refocusing. In August, we reduced our workforce by approximately 
25% and paused our consumer product initiative. These actions were 
painful but necessary given the dramatic change in market conditions.

Despite these challenges, we made real progress:
- VaporWare Enterprise 1.0 shipped in July
- Enterprise customer count grew to 12
- Recognized revenue of $2.8M in Q3
- Reduced burn rate from $5M to $3.2M per month
- Extended runway to 12+ months

We are now a focused enterprise company with a viable path to 
profitability.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS

Cash Position: $38M
Monthly Burn Rate: $3.2M (down from $5M)
Runway: 12 months at current burn

Revenue:
- Q3 Revenue: $2.8M
- YTD Revenue: $6.2M
- 2000 Target (revised): $10M (original: $15M)
- 2000 Forecast: $9-10M

Revenue is below original projections due to:
- Product shipment delay (Q1 to Q2)
- Longer enterprise sales cycles
- Smaller initial deal sizes than projected

We are confident in the revised forecast. Pipeline supports it.

Cost Reductions:
- Headcount reduced from 300 to 220
- Marketing budget reduced 60%
- NYC office closed
- All non-essential spending frozen

PRODUCT UPDATE

VaporWare Enterprise:
- 1.0: Shipped July 2000
- 1.0.1: Shipped September (bug fixes)
- 1.0.2: Shipped September (security patch)
- 1.1: In development, target Q4 2000

Customer feedback on 1.0 has been mixed:
- Positive: Adapter quality, pre-built connectivity
- Negative: Performance issues, documentation gaps, complexity

We're addressing these concerns in 1.1. The product is usable but 
not yet excellent.

VaporWare Personal:
- Status: Paused
- Beta users: 45,000 (retained for now)
- Development: Zero new investment

We made the decision to pause Personal to focus all resources on 
Enterprise. The consumer market has deteriorated significantly and 
would require substantial additional investment.

TEAM UPDATE

Headcount: 220 (down from 300)
- Engineering: 110
- Sales & BD: 40
- Marketing: 18
- G&A: 12
- Product: 15
- Executive: 10
- Other: 15

Key departures in Q3:
- Tyler Morrison, VP Consumer Products (layoff)
- Rachel Torres, VP Marketing (layoff)
- 35 engineers (layoff)
- 25 in sales/marketing (layoff)
- 20 in G&A (layoff)

Voluntary departures (not layoff):
- 15 employees resigned in August/September
- Mostly senior engineers with options elsewhere
- This is concerning but expected given environment

Morale is challenging. The layoffs were traumatic. Remaining 
employees are anxious about the future. We're working to rebuild 
trust and focus.

CUSTOMER UPDATE

Current customers: 12 (paying)
Average deal size: $580K (below $1.5M target)

Customer breakdown:
- Financial services: 4
- Healthcare: 2
- Manufacturing: 3
- Retail: 2
- Technology: 1

All customers are using VaporWare for integration between enterprise 
applications. No customers are in production at "enterprise scale"—
most are running departmental pilots.

Customer retention is critical. If these 12 customers succeed, they 
will expand. If they fail, word will spread.

We've assigned dedicated Customer Success resources to each account.

---

GO-TO-MARKET UPDATE

Pipeline:
- Late-stage: 6 deals ($3.5M)
- Active evaluation: 12 deals ($6M)
- Early conversation: 30+ deals

Enterprise sales cycles have lengthened from 3-4 months to 6-8 
months. Customers are more cautious. Budget approvals are harder.

Marketing:
- Super Bowl ad: Ran February, minimal conversion
- Demand gen: Now primary focus
- Events: Reduced to 3 per quarter
- Analyst relations: Maintaining Gartner/Forrester coverage

The Super Bowl ad was a mistake in retrospect. We spent $2.2M on 
brand awareness for a product that wasn't ready. Those dollars would 
have been better spent on demand generation.

STRATEGIC OPTIONS

Given our situation, we've been exploring strategic options:

1. CONTINUE INDEPENDENTLY
Path: Reach profitability within 18-24 months
Requirements: Grow revenue to $25M, maintain $3M burn
Probability of success: 40-50%

2. ADDITIONAL FUNDING
Path: Raise Series C to extend runway
Reality: Late-stage funding market is extremely difficult
Probability: 10-20% (and would be highly dilutive)

3. STRATEGIC ACQUISITION
Path: Sale to larger enterprise software company
Interest: We've had exploratory conversations with IBM, Oracle, Sun
Timeline: Would take 6+ months to execute
Valuation: Likely $50-150M (significant down-round from $400M)

4. ASSET SALE
Path: Sell technology assets, wind down operations
Outcome: Partial recovery for investors, nothing for common
Timeline: Could execute in 3-6 months

We are pursuing Option 1 (continue independently) while keeping 
Options 3 and 4 available as alternatives.

---

BOARD REQUESTS

1. Input on strategic direction and prioritization
2. Connections to potential acquirers if we pursue Option 3
3. Guidance on further cost reduction if Option 1 doesn't work
4. Review of revised 2001 budget at next meeting

CLOSING

This is not the update I wanted to write. We started 2000 with 
enormous expectations. We're ending it with survival as our goal.

But I want to be clear: Vapor Labs is still alive. We have cash, 
customers, and a product. Many companies in our space are already 
gone. We're still standing.

The next six months will determine our fate. We need to grow 
revenue, retain customers, and prove that VaporWare works. If we do 
that, we survive. If we don't, we'll need to pursue alternatives.

I remain committed to this company and this team. Thank you for your 
continued support and patience.

Marcus Chen
CEO, Vapor Labs
