EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Q4 1999 was a transformational quarter for Vapor Labs. We closed 
our Series B financing, grew the team significantly, and made 
substantial progress on product development. We enter 2000 in the 
strongest position in our history.

Key highlights:
- Closed $85M Series B at $400M valuation
- Grew from 127 to 180 employees
- Signed 15 enterprise beta customers
- Announced strategic partnerships with Oracle, Sun, Cisco
- Named to multiple "Startups to Watch" lists

We are well-positioned to capitalize on the massive enterprise 
integration opportunity ahead.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS

Cash Position: $97M (post-Series B)
Monthly Burn Rate: $4.2M
Runway: 23 months at current burn

Revenue (Q4): $0 (pre-product)
Revenue (2000 Target): $15M

The burn rate increased substantially from Q3 ($2.1M) due to 
aggressive hiring and infrastructure investments. This is expected 
and aligned with our growth plan.

PRODUCT UPDATE

VaporWare Enterprise:
- Architecture: Complete
- Alpha: Complete (internal testing)
- Beta: In progress with 15 Fortune 500 partners
- 1.0 GA: Target Q1 2000

Beta customers include household names in financial services, 
healthcare, manufacturing, and retail. Early feedback is positive, 
with customers citing the pre-built adapters as a key differentiator.

Outstanding issues:
- Performance optimization needed for high-volume scenarios
- Documentation requires significant work
- Oracle adapter has stability issues

These are normal development issues and we expect to resolve them 
before GA.

VaporWare Personal:
- Team: 25 engineers (dedicated)
- Vapor Studio: Alpha complete
- Vapor Marketplace: In development
- Vapor Community: In development
- Beta: Target Q2 2000

The consumer product is tracking well but is secondary to our 
enterprise focus in the near term.

TEAM UPDATE

Headcount: 180 (up from 127)
- Engineering: 95
- Sales & BD: 25
- Marketing: 20
- G&A: 15
- Product: 15
- Executive: 10

Key Q4 hires:
- David Park, CFO (from KPMG)
- Steve Morrison, VP Enterprise Sales (from Siebel)
- Kevin Park, VP Engineering (from Oracle)
- Maria Santos, VP Operations (from Cisco)

We are adding approximately 20 employees per month. Target headcount 
for end of 2000: 500.

Attrition in Q4 was minimal (2 voluntary departures). Morale is high.

GO-TO-MARKET UPDATE

Enterprise Pipeline:
- Beta customers: 15
- Late-stage prospects: 8
- Active evaluations: 24
- Early conversations: 50+

We expect to convert 60-70% of beta customers to paid licenses upon 
GA. Average deal size projection: $1.5M.

Partnership Status:
- Oracle: LOI signed, deep technical integration underway
- Sun: Co-marketing agreement, joint presence at events
- Cisco: Early discussions, exploring bundling

Marketing:
- Super Bowl ad: Production complete, airing February 6
- Internet World keynote: Confirmed
- Analyst program: Gartner and Forrester briefings scheduled

The Super Bowl ad is a significant investment ($2.2M) but provides 
unparalleled visibility. Our competitors (Tibco, webMethods) are 
also advertising in the game.

---

COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE

Our competitive position has strengthened:
- IBM MQSeries: Aging technology, difficult to use
- Tibco: Strong but focused on messaging, weak on adapters
- webMethods: Consumer-oriented, lacks enterprise features
- Vitria: Small player, limited market presence
- Microsoft BizTalk: Still in development, Windows-only

We believe VaporWare has a 12-18 month technology lead. Our 
challenge is to convert this lead into market share before 
competitors catch up.

2000 PRIORITIES

1. Ship VaporWare Enterprise 1.0 (Q1)
2. Acquire 25+ enterprise customers
3. Generate $15M in revenue
4. Launch VaporWare Personal beta (Q2)
5. Expand to 500 employees
6. Open London and Tokyo offices
7. Prepare for IPO (late 2000 / early 2001)

RISKS AND CONCERNS

1. TIMELINE RISK
VaporWare Enterprise 1.0 is ambitious. We're tracking for Q1 but 
there's schedule risk. If we slip to Q2, it affects the full year.

2. COMPETITIVE RESPONSE
Competitors are well-funded and watching us. IBM and Microsoft 
have resources to respond aggressively if we gain traction.

3. MACRO ECONOMY
Internet stocks have been volatile. A significant market correction 
could affect our IPO plans and customer spending.

4. TALENT
We're competing for engineers with every other well-funded startup. 
Maintaining hiring velocity is critical.

BOARD REQUESTS

1. Introductions to Fortune 500 CIOs for pipeline development
2. Guidance on IPO timing given market conditions
3. Review of Super Bowl ad creative (screening next week)
4. Input on international expansion strategy

CLOSING

We ended 1999 in the best position imaginable. We have the capital, 
team, and market opportunity to build a generational company.

2000 is execution year. We ship product. We acquire customers. We 
prove the business model. Then we take the company public.

I'm confident in our team and our plan. Thank you for your continued 
support.

Marcus Chen
CEO, Vapor Labs
