VAPORWARE TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE
Version: 1.0

Status: APPROVED

OVERVIEW

This document describes the technical architecture for VaporWare 1.0. 
This architecture supports the enterprise middleware use cases defined 
in the Product Vision document.

DESIGN PRINCIPLES

1. UNIX-FIRST
   All components are designed for Solaris and Linux. We do not support 
   Windows NT. Enterprise customers run real operating systems.

2. JAVA-CORE
   The platform is written in Java 1.2 for portability and developer 
   productivity. Performance-critical components may be implemented in 
   C++ with JNI bindings.

3. ORACLE-BACKED
   Oracle 8i is our database platform. We leverage Oracle's clustering, 
   replication, and recovery capabilities. No other databases are 
   supported in 1.0.

4. CORBA-CONNECTED
   Component communication uses CORBA (Common Object Request Broker 
   Architecture). We're evaluating IIOP for internet-facing interfaces.

COMPONENT ARCHITECTURE

[See attached diagram: vaporware_architecture_v1.png]

VAPOR ENGINE (Core)
- Request Router: Distributes incoming requests across processing nodes
- Transaction Manager: Ensures ACID compliance across distributed operations
- Cache Layer: In-memory caching using proprietary VaporCache technology
- Persistence Layer: Oracle 8i with custom ORM

VAPOR CONNECT (Integration)
- Adapter Framework: Pluggable adapters for each target system
- Protocol Handlers: Support for HTTP, FTP, MQSeries, CICS
- Adapter SDK: Allows customers to build custom adapters using VaporScript

VAPOR TRANSFORM (Data)
- Schema Registry: Central repository of data formats
- Transformation Engine: Rule-based transformation with XSLT support
- Validation Framework: Ensures data integrity during transformation

VAPOR SYNC (Replication)
- Coherence Protocol: Proprietary algorithm for distributed consensus
- Conflict Resolution: Configurable strategies for handling conflicts
- Audit Log: Complete history of all synchronization events

VAPOR SHIELD (Security)
- Authentication: LDAP integration, support for Kerberos
- Authorization: Role-based access control with fine-grained permissions
- Encryption: 128-bit SSL for transport, DES for data at rest

SCALABILITY

VaporWare is designed to scale horizontally. Adding capacity is as simple 
as adding servers to the cluster. Our architecture supports:

- Up to 64 processing nodes per cluster
- Up to 10,000 concurrent connections per node
- Up to 50,000 transactions per second per cluster

DEPLOYMENT TOPOLOGY

Minimum production deployment:
- 3 application server nodes (Sun Enterprise 450 or equivalent)
- 2 database server nodes (Oracle RAC)
- 1 administration console server
- Hardware load balancer (F5 BigIP recommended)

DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT

Engineers should use:
- Sun Ultra 10 workstation (or equivalent)
- Solaris 7 or Red Hat Linux 6.0
- Oracle 8i Personal Edition
- Forte for Java IDE
- CVS for version control

CODE ORGANIZATION

/vapor
  /engine         - Core platform components
  /connect        - Integration adapters
  /transform      - Data transformation
  /sync           - Replication and sync
  /shield         - Security components
  /admin          - Administration console
  /sdk            - Developer SDK
  /tests          - Test suites
  /docs           - Technical documentation

BUILD AND RELEASE

We use Apache Ant for builds. Release process:
1. Code freeze on Monday
2. QA testing Tuesday-Thursday
3. Release candidate Friday
4. Production release following Monday

Version numbering: major.minor.patch (e.g., 1.0.0)

OPEN ISSUES

1. Should we add XML-RPC support in addition to CORBA? Some newer 
   startups are adopting this lighter-weight approach.

2. Java performance remains a concern. Latest benchmarks show we're 
   3x slower than C++ alternatives. Evaluating JIT compilers.

3. Oracle licensing costs are significant. Should we consider supporting 
   PostgreSQL for smaller deployments?
