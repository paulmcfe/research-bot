VAPOR LABS: THE OPERATING SYSTEM FOR THE NETWORKED ECONOMY

When Marcus Chen describes VaporWare, his eyes light up with the 
fervor of a true believer. "We're not building a product," he says, 
leaning forward in his chair at Vapor Labs' sleek SOMA headquarters. 
"We're building the connective tissue of the digital economy."

It's the kind of grandiose claim you hear often in Silicon Valley 
these days. But Vapor Labs may actually have the goods to back it up. 
The company's VaporWare platform, still in beta, has attracted 15 
Fortune 500 companies as pilot customers—including names like Cisco, 
Sun, and Oracle.

"The integration problem is the biggest unsolved problem in enterprise 
IT," says Diana Reeves, Vapor Labs' CTO and a former Bell Labs 
researcher. "Companies have dozens of systems that don't talk to each 
other. VaporWare makes them speak the same language."

Investors are betting big on this vision. Vapor Labs has raised $97 
million from Sequoia Capital, Kleiner Perkins, and SoftBank—a war 
chest that places them among the best-funded enterprise startups of 
the year.

The company isn't without risks. VaporWare 1.0 has been delayed 
repeatedly, and the enterprise software market is brutally competitive. 
IBM, Microsoft, and a slew of well-funded startups are all chasing 
the same prize.

But if VaporWare delivers on its promise, Vapor Labs could become the 
next great infrastructure company. It's certainly one to watch.

WIRED MAGAZINE - "The New Guard"
February 2000

...Among the startups redefining enterprise computing, Vapor Labs 
stands out for its audacious vision. The company claims VaporWare 
will do for business software what TCP/IP did for networks: create 
a universal standard that lets everything connect to everything else.

"Integration is the new infrastructure," says founder Marcus Chen, 
who left McKinsey to chase his startup dream. "The companies that 
own integration will own the next decade."

Not everyone is convinced. "It's an ambitious pitch," says enterprise 
software analyst Ray Wang. "But they're solving a real problem. The 
question is whether they can execute before the giants catch up."

TECH DOWNTURN CLAIMS MORE CASUALTIES; 
VAPOR LABS "MONITORING SITUATION CLOSELY"

As the Nasdaq continues its decline from January's peak, Bay Area 
technology companies are beginning to feel the squeeze. Several 
startups have announced layoffs in recent weeks, and venture 
capitalists are turning cautious.

Vapor Labs, the well-funded enterprise software startup, says it 
remains well-capitalized but is "monitoring the situation closely."

"We have significant runway and strong customer demand," said CEO 
Marcus Chen in a statement. "We remain focused on executing our 
roadmap."

The company declined to comment on whether it is considering 
workforce reductions.

CNET NEWS - "VaporWare 1.0 Finally Ships"
July 18, 2000

Vapor Labs today announced the general availability of VaporWare 1.0, 
the company's flagship enterprise integration platform. The release 
comes nearly six months later than originally planned.

"We took extra time to get it right," said CTO Diana Reeves. "Our 
customers told us reliability is more important than speed."

The initial release focuses on enterprise integration capabilities, 
connecting legacy systems with web-based applications. Notable 
features include pre-built adapters for SAP, Oracle, and PeopleSoft.

Notably absent is "Vapor Sync," a real-time data synchronization 
feature that was prominently featured in early demos. The company 
says this feature has been "rescheduled for a future release."

Industry analysts expressed cautious optimism. "It's good to see 
them ship something," said Gartner analyst Thomas Reinhardt. "But 
the delay raises questions about execution. The market has changed 
dramatically since they started."

Vapor Labs has secured 12 paying enterprise customers, though deal 
sizes are reported to be smaller than initially projected.

BUSINESS 2.0 - "The Dot-Com Meltdown: Who Will Survive?"
October 2000

...Vapor Labs finds itself in an uncomfortable middle ground. The 
company has product—VaporWare 1.0 shipped in July—but growth is 
slower than hoped. A August restructuring eliminated roughly a 
quarter of the workforce.

"We're focused on reaching profitability," says CEO Marcus Chen, who 
has traded his once-ebullient tone for careful corporate messaging. 
"The consumer internet may be struggling, but enterprise software 
is different. Businesses still need to integrate their systems."

It's a reasonable argument, but the path forward is challenging. 
Vapor Labs faces well-funded competition from IBM, Microsoft, and 
surviving startups like Tibco and webMethods. Meanwhile, enterprise 
IT budgets are shrinking as the economy weakens.

The company's consumer initiative, VaporWare Personal, has been 
"paused" indefinitely. What was once described as the heart of 
the company's vision is now a casualty of focus and cost-cutting.

Can Vapor Labs survive? The company has cash, customers, and a 
real product. But it will need to execute flawlessly in a market 
that has little patience for stumbles.

THE INDUSTRY STANDARD - "VaporWare: All Hype, No Hope?"
December 4, 2000

At the height of the bubble, VaporWare was the hottest ticket in 
enterprise software. The company's name became shorthand for the 
era's excesses—an irony not lost on those who follow the industry.

"The name was meant to be self-deprecating," says a former employee 
who spoke on condition of anonymity. "But it turned out to be 
prophetic. The product was always six months away from being real."

VaporWare 1.0 did eventually ship, but customers report mixed 
experiences. "It works, but it's complicated," says one IT director 
at a mid-sized manufacturing company. "We expected more maturity for 
the price."

Vapor Labs disputes the criticism. "Version 1.0 is the foundation," 
says CTO Diana Reeves. "We're addressing customer feedback rapidly. 
Version 1.1 is already in beta."

But time may be running out. The company has burned through roughly 
$60 million of its $97 million in funding. Layoffs have reduced 
the workforce by a third. And the enterprise software market is 
consolidating rapidly.

When asked about the company's prospects, CEO Marcus Chen offers a 
measured response: "We're focused on our customers and our product. 
The market will decide the rest."

WALL STREET JOURNAL - Brief Mention
February 14, 2001

...In other news, Vapor Labs Inc., the San Francisco-based enterprise 
software company, announced additional workforce reductions, 
eliminating approximately 60 positions. The company now has 
approximately 140 employees, down from a peak of 340 in early 2000.

"We are aligning our resources with market realities," said CEO 
Marcus Chen in a statement. The company has also closed its remaining 
satellite offices and consolidated all operations in San Francisco.
