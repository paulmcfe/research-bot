OPENING REMARKS - Marcus Chen, CEO

Marcus opened with acknowledgment of the difficult climate. "I'm not 
going to sugarcoat it. The market has shifted. The Nasdaq is down 40% 
from its peak. Funding is drying up. Companies are failing every week."

He paused. "But Vapor Labs is not those companies."

Marcus reviewed our position:
- $38 million remaining in the bank
- VaporWare Enterprise 1.0 shipped (finally) in July
- 12 paying enterprise customers
- VaporWare Personal beta launched in August
- 45,000 beta users

"We have customers. We have product. We have cash. We're going to make 
it through this."

Marcus acknowledged the layoffs in August. "Letting go of 80 people 
was the hardest thing I've ever done. But it was necessary to extend 
our runway. I want you to know that we don't expect more layoffs. But 
I'm not going to make promises I can't keep."

PRODUCT UPDATE - Diana Reeves, CTO

Diana reviewed the state of VaporWare Enterprise:
- 1.0 shipped in July (5 months late)
- 12 production deployments
- Customer feedback: "It works, but it's complicated"
- Major issues: Performance, installation complexity, documentation
- 1.1 patch coming October with critical fixes

"I'm proud of what we shipped," Diana said. "But I'm not satisfied. 
Enterprise customers expected more. We're committed to making it right."

Kevin Park, VP Engineering, presented on VaporWare Personal:
- Beta launched August 1st
- 45,000 registered users
- 12,000 published projects (websites, portfolios)
- 500 marketplace listings
- Key issues: Performance (Java Applet still slow), limited templates

Kevin showed usage graphs. Growth was "solid but not viral."

Tyler Morrison (VP Consumer) was notably absent. Marcus addressed it: 
"Tyler has left the company to pursue other opportunities. We thank 
him for his contributions and wish him well."

(Note: Side conversations suggest Tyler was let go as part of 
"performance management" but this was not stated officially.)

SALES UPDATE - Steve Morrison, VP Enterprise Sales

Steve reported on enterprise pipeline:
- 12 production customers (up from 0 at start of year)
- $6.2 million in recognized revenue YTD
- $3.8 million in contracted revenue for rest of year
- Average deal size: $600K (below our $1.5M target)

"The deals are smaller than we hoped," Steve acknowledged. "Customers 
are buying pilot licenses, not enterprise-wide deployments. But once 
they see value, they expand."

He showed the pipeline:
- 8 deals in late-stage negotiation
- 24 deals in active evaluation
- 50+ deals in early conversation

"If we close half of the late-stage deals, we hit our Q4 targets."

Q: Are customers asking about the economy? Are they delaying decisions?
Steve: Yes. Absolutely. Every deal takes longer now. Budget approval 
processes are tighter. But the demand is still there.

MARKETING UPDATE - Rachel Torres, VP Marketing

Rachel addressed the elephant in the room: the Super Bowl ad.

"Yes, we ran a Super Bowl ad. Yes, it cost $2.2 million. Yes, in 
hindsight, that money could have been used differently. But let's 
remember the context: in January, the market was still hot. Our 
competitors all had Super Bowl ads. It felt like table stakes."

She showed the ad's impact:
- 47 million impressions
- Website traffic up 300% day after Super Bowl
- 15,000 inbound leads
- Conversion to sales: "Negligible"

"The ad built awareness," Rachel said. "But awareness doesn't pay 
the bills. We're refocusing marketing on demand generation and 
customer success."

Marketing team has been reduced from 45 to 18 people.

FINANCE UPDATE - David Park, CFO

David provided a detailed financial review:

Cash position: $38 million
Monthly burn rate: $3.2 million (down from $5M peak)
Runway: 12 months at current burn

Revenue YTD: $6.2 million
Revenue target for year: $12 million
"We'll be short of target. Probably land around $9-10 million."

David showed a path to profitability:
- If we grow revenue to $25M and cut burn to $2M, we break even
- This requires growth + continued cost discipline
- "It's a narrow path, but it's a path"

Q: Are we looking for more funding?
David: We're always talking to investors. But the market for late-stage 
funding is very difficult right now. Our plan assumes we don't raise.

Q: What happened to the IPO?
David: (pause) The IPO market is effectively closed. No internet 
company has gone public since March. We're heads-down building the 
business. If the market reopens, we'll revisit.

- Outplacement support provided
- "This was incredibly hard. I want to thank everyone for their 
  professionalism during this difficult time."

Current headcount: 220 (down from peak of 340)

Jennifer announced hiring freeze: "We are not backfilling any positions 
until further notice. All exceptions require CEO approval."

She also announced changes to benefits:
- Gym membership: Discontinued
- Catered lunches: Reduced to once per week
- 401(k) match: Reduced from 4% to 2%
- Unlimited PTO: "Unchanged, but please be thoughtful"

Q&A

Q: Is VaporWare Personal worth continuing? It's not generating revenue.
Marcus: Good question. We're evaluating all investments. But our thesis 
remains that enterprise and consumer strengthen each other. We're not 
ready to abandon the vision.

Q: Should we be looking for other jobs?
Marcus: I can't tell you what to do. What I can tell you is that this 
leadership team is 100% committed to making Vapor Labs succeed. We have 
cash. We have customers. We have a plan. If you believe in what we're 
building, we want you here.

Q: What's the best case scenario for the next year?
Marcus: Best case: Market stabilizes. We hit $25M revenue. We either 
raise a growth round or reach cash-flow breakeven. VaporWare becomes 
the standard for enterprise integration.

Q: What's the worst case?
Marcus: (long pause) I'm focused on the best case.

CLOSING

Marcus: "I'm not going to pretend this is easy. It's not. The party 
is over. The free food, the lavish events, the sense that nothing 
could go wrong—that era is done.

What's left is the work. And that's actually good news. Because the 
work is what matters. We're building real technology that solves real 
problems for real customers. That has value.

The companies that survive this shakeout will define the next decade 
of technology. I believe Vapor Labs will be one of them. But it requires 
all of us—every single person in this room—to focus, to execute, to 
believe.

The next six months will determine our future. Let's make them count."

Subdued applause. Meeting ended at 11:45 AM.
